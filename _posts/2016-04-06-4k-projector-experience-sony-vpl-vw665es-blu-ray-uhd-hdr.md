description: "Greetings projector fans, I am pleased to report that 4K viewing at 124″ diagonal, using Blu-ray UHD has come to pass here in my home theater. It is an awesome experience! I still have in my possession, the true 4K Sony VPL-VW665ES projector (yep, the one that's $14,999), for one more week."
