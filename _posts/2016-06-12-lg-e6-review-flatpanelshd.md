  LG has released a new generation of 4K OLED displays. Last year, we reviewed
  LG EG9600 and Panasonic CZ950 , both of which were based on the last
  generation of OLED. This year, LG's OLEDs should offer better HDR (high
  dynamic range) and a wider color gamut almost fully compliant with DCI-P3
  space.
