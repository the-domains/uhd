  LG's last couple of OLED TVs have been pretty damn amazing - we've thought so,
  at least. There's an even better and more visually arresting TV about to hit
  electronics stores shelves, though; the new G6T Signature is a $10,999 OLED
  monster supporting the latest and greatest Dolby Vision and HDR codecs, with a
  built-in soundbar for serious audio.
