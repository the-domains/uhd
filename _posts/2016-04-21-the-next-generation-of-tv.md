description: "At Netflix, pushing the boundaries on video quality is one of our passions. We're particularly excited about High Dynamic Range - or HDR. While 4k offers more pixels, HDR offers better pixels that have greater depth, and on HDR screens you get brighter highlights, more detail in dark scenes, and a wider color range that more closely matches the real world."
