  "No boundaries" is the tagline Microsoft keeps touting for Project Scorpio, a
  hardware refresh/upgrade for the Xbox One announced during its E3 press

  expect to hear much more about it until next year-the console's not coming
  until Holiday 2017, and we didn't even get a good look at it yet.
