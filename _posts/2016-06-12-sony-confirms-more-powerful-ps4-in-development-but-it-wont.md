      https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/n-plus-plus-ps4/ It's finally
      here! N++ is now available on PlayStation4. http://www.nplusplus.org In
      this fast-paced, action-packed puzzle platformer set in the distant 2D
      future, you play as a ninja -- darting through obstacles, narrowly evading
      a slew of inadvertently homicidal enemy robots, and collecting gold in a
      minimalist, sci-fi world.
